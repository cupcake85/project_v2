        <h1>SAii Phi Phi Island Village</h1>
        <p>
          SAii Phi Phi Island Village Welcome to our resort Escape to SAii Phi
          Phi Island Village, a dream-like tropical resort on a private
          800-metre stretch of pristine white sandy beach lapped by the
          turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea. This lavish Phi Phi Island resort
          is set amid 70 acres of coconut palm plantations, in the privacy of
          Loh Ba Gao Bay on the peaceful northeast coast of beautiful Phi Phi
          Island. Accommodations include 189 traditional Thai-style bungalows
          and 12 exclusive Hillside Pool Villas. Each villa has its own private
          pool overlooking the island’s magnificent scenery. Resort facilities
          include five restaurants, three bars, a spa, gift shop, recreation
          centre, 5-Star PADI dive centre, fitness room, two large swimming
          pools and tennis courts. At the Marine Discovery Centre, experts
          educate and inspire guests and locals with sustainability efforts
          including raising baby sharks and clownfish. Having been off-limits to
          the public for three and a half years to allow for environmental
          rejuvenation, Maya Bay in Ko Phi Phi National Park has now officially
          reopened to tourists and, as one of Thailand’s true national
          treasures, is a must-visit destination.
